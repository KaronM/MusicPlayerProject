# MusicPlayerProject
Data Structures and Algorithms 1 final project.

Music Playlist Manager: Create an application to manage music playlists, using LinkedLists for song order and Stacks to track play history. The project can explore how different data structures can be used for real-world applications like media playback.

Develop a proof of concept program that illustrates some, if not all, of the functionality proposed in the research paper.

Focus on demonstrating how the chosen data structures are implemented and utilized in the program.
